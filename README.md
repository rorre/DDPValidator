# DDP Validator

DDP 1 answer validator, just to ensure if everything is 1:1 with spec or not. I decided to open source this because I feel like this is pretty neat. **Lab 6 test case is not available yet.**

## Why

I'm lazy to reinput all inputs every time I have I make changes, and checking them. So yeah.

## How

1. Go to releases
2. Get the file
3. Drag and drop the folder where your task is on
4. ???
5. Profit!
